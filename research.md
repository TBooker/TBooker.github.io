Broadly speaking, I am interested in natural selection and how it can be detected using DNA sequence data. 

If you spend enough time with me, I'm bound to start talking about selective sweeps and background selection. I am very interested in how these two processes affect variation in genetic diversity in eukaryotes, and specifically, what their footprints can tell us about moleular evolution.


## Current Projects

### Global adaptation in structured populations

I am currently working on a project looking at how global adaptation affects out ability to detect selecton using genome scans. In particular, we are asking whether recurrent positive selection generates Fst outliers in genome scans aimed at identifying local adaptation. 

This project is part of my postdoc with Mike Whitlock at UBC and Sam Yeaman at the University of Calgary.

### Adaptation molecular evolution in murid rodents

This project carries on where my 2018 MBE paper left off. In that paper, one of the main conclusions was that background selection on its own could not generate the troughs in diversity seen in *Mus musculus castaneus*, but that selective sweeps as generated by the parameters of the DFE estimated from the site frequnecy spectrum couldn't either. A way forward is to use the patterns of diversity to estimate parameters of positive selection that are consistent with observed data. We are pursuing this using a dataset containing population genomic data for the three principal sub-species of *Mus musculus* as well as the sister species *Mus spretus*

This work is in collaboration with researchers at the Universities of Edinburgh and Cambridge.
