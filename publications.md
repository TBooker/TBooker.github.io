I try to publish open access when possible and deposit all my first author papers on BioRXiv. If you can't get hold of any of my publications, get in touch and I'd be more than happy to send you a copy.

 ~~I've also head that sci-hub is pretty cool~~

## PhD Thesis

In case any one is interested, you can take a look at my [PhD thesis](/papers/thesis.pdf).

In case you are interested, I used a latex template from the [University of Edinburgh's Geoscience department](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/intranet/it/faq/latexthesis).
